## 🌘 Dark Mode

This website includes a Dark Mode toggle button implemented with vanilla JavaScript:

```js
const button = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  document.body.classList.toggle('dark-mode');
});

It applies additional CSS styles when .dark-mode is enabled, enhancing readability and user comfort at night.
